## üìù Project Description

**Precision Countdown Timer Pro** is a polished and user-friendly desktop application developed using C++ Builder and its Visual Component Library (VCL). It provides a clear, real-time countdown from a user-specified (or default) number of seconds, displaying the remaining time in a convenient HH:MM:SS format. The timer updates every second, offering precise tracking. A key feature is its ability to minimize to the system tray, allowing for unobtrusive operation while keeping the countdown active. Upon reaching zero, the timer clearly indicates "END OF TIME!" and halts. This application is ideal for managing tasks, breaks, or any scenario requiring accurate time monitoring.

## ‚ú® Key Features

*   ‚è≥ **Accurate Countdown**: Displays remaining time in HH:MM:SS format, updating every second.
*   üéØ **Customizable Duration**: Starts from a predefined number of seconds (default: 3666s), easily modifiable in the source code.
*   ‚öôÔ∏è **1-Second Interval**: Utilizes a `TTimer` component with a 1000ms interval for precise second-by-second updates.
*   -**System Tray Integration**:
    *   Minimizes neatly to the Windows system tray.
    *   Easily restore the application window by clicking the tray icon.
*   üîî **End-of-Time Notification**: Clearly displays "END OF TIME!" on the GUI label when the countdown completes.
*   üñ•Ô∏è **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Built with VCL components for a native Windows look and feel.

## ‚öôÔ∏è System Requirements & VCL Components

### Software:
*   **Development Environment**: Embarcadero C++ Builder (with VCL support).
*   **Operating System**: Windows (as it leverages Windows system tray functionality and VCL).

### Key VCL Components Used:
*   `TForm`: The main application window.
*   `TTimer`: Manages the one-second interval for updating the countdown.
*   `TLabel`: Displays the countdown time (HH:MM:SS) and the final "END OF TIME!" message.
*   `TTrayIcon`: Enables the application to minimize to and be restored from the system tray.

### Project Files:
*   Form definition file (`*.dfm`, typically `Unit1.dfm`)
*   Form header file (`Unit1.h`) and corresponding source file (`Unit1.cpp`)
*   Main project file (`*.cbproj`)

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation and Running

1.  **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```
    (Replace `<repository-url>` with the URL of your repository)

2.  **Open the Project in C++ Builder**:
    Navigate to the cloned directory and open the main project file (e.g., `Project1.cbproj` or similar) using Embarcadero C++ Builder.

3.  **Verify Project Setup**:
    Ensure that `Unit1.h`, `Unit1.cpp`, and the associated `Unit1.dfm` file are correctly included in the project and that all VCL components (TTimer, TLabel, TTrayIcon) are properly configured in the Form Designer.

4.  **Build and Run**:
    *   Compile (Build) the project from the C++ Builder IDE.
    *   Run the application.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Use

1.  **Launch the Application**:
    Once compiled, run the executable file.
2.  **Automatic Start**:
    The countdown timer will start automatically from the predefined duration (default is 3666 seconds, which is 1 hour, 1 minute, and 6 seconds). *To change this, you'll need to modify the initial value of the `s` variable (or equivalent) in the `Unit1.cpp` source code before compiling.*
3.  **View Countdown**:
    The remaining time will be displayed on the application's main label in HH:MM:SS format, updating every second.
4.  **Minimize to System Tray**:
    To minimize the application without closing it, click the standard minimize button on the window. The application will hide from the taskbar and an icon will appear in the system tray.
5.  **Restore from System Tray**:
    Click the application's icon in the system tray to restore the main window.
6.  **Countdown Completion**:
    When the timer reaches 00:00:00, the `TTimer` will stop, and the label will display "END OF TIME!".

## üí° Technical Notes & Customization

*   **Countdown Duration**: The initial countdown duration is hardcoded within `Unit1.cpp` (e.g., `int s = 3666;`). To set a different starting time, modify this value and recompile the project.
*   **Timer Interval**: The `TTimer` component's `Interval` property is typically set to `1000` (milliseconds) in the Object Inspector within the C++ Builder Form Designer to ensure updates occur every second.
*   **HH:MM:SS Formatting**: The conversion from total seconds to HH:MM:SS format is handled within the `TTimer`'s `OnTimer` event handler.
*   **System Tray Logic**: The `TTrayIcon` component handles the visibility and click events for system tray interaction. Form events like `OnCloseQuery` or `OnMinimize` might be used to control the minimize-to-tray behavior.
